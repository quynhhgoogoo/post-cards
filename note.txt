1. DIFFERENT BETWEEN CONTAINER AND WRAPPER
A. CONTAINER : used for structures that can contain more than one element
B. WRAPPER : something that wraps arround a single object to provide more functionalities and interfaces
to it


2.DIFFERENT BETWEEN ID AND CLASS
A. ID:
- are unique
- each page can only have one element with that ID
- go with #

B. CLASS:
- use same class on multiple elements
- use multiple classes on the same elements
- go with dot (.)


3.BOX SIZING:
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

This means : Element often appears bigger than what you have set

Box sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total
width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element padding and border
are included in the width and height


4. ::before and ::after
:: after => insert something after the content of each selected elements
:: before => insert some thing before the content of each selected elements
Eg : Insert something (text) before the content of each <p> elements
		p::before{
			content:"Read this";
		}


5. AUTO ELEMENT:
- adjust value automatically according to the content or the context of element
Eg : + height : auto => will go taller as it contains more text
     + margin : 0 auto => will have left and right margins increased until it becomes
		centered along the y-axis of the viewport



6. POSITION:
 - relative: Dùng d? thi?t l?p m?t ph?n t? s? d?ng các thu?c tính position (xem ? du?i) mà không làm ?nh hu?ng d?n vi?c hi?n th? ban d?u.
 - absolute: Dùng d? thi?t l?p v? trí c?a m?t ph?n t? nhung nó s? luôn n?m trong m?t ph?n t? m? dang là relative.
 - fixed: Hi?n th? luôn di theo trình duy?t khi cu?n trang.
 - static: Ðua ph?n t? v? hi?n th? theo ki?u m?c d?nh.
